| [FpsPlus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fpsplus-lagfixes) | Unknown | This mod boosts your FPS by changing math functions to be either faster or less intensive. | Client | Author recommends args `-server -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods`, lol. Description of the versions: FpsPlus (A) uses Rivens Normal, plus is a fork with a few extra fixes and changes. B uses SinHalf/CosHalf, C may be more stable and has a MathHelper rework, D uses Libfdx. You may require arguments `-Dfml.ignoreInvalidMinecraftCertificates=true -Dfml.ignorePatchDiscrepancies=true`, because of course you do. |
| [OptiFine](https://optifine.net) | Unknown | This mod adds support for HD textures and a lot of options for better looks and performance. Doubling the FPS is common. | Client | We're making an exception, just for this. Must be installed as a jarmod (in minecraft.jar). |

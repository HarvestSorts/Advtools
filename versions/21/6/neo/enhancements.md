| [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade) |  Unknown | Shows information about what you are looking at. (Hwyla/Waila fork for Minecraft 1.16+) | Client | Install on the server for extra information. Also install Jade Addons for modded scenarios. |
| [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) | Unknown | Makes chat unreportable (where possible) | Both | If you cannot install NCR on the server, install [FreedomChat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/freedomchat) instead, which is plugin compatible. Can be installed on either or, but if only the client has it and the server is unconfigured, the game might still force chat reports. A necessary addition since Gaslight. |

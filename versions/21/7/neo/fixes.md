| [XaeroPlus](https://modrinth.com/mod/EnPUzSTg) | Unknown |  XaeroPlus is a client-side Minecraft mod that depends on and modifies the Xaero's WorldMap and Minimap mods with extra features and performance improvements - particularly for use on anarchy servers like 2b2t. | Client | Main gimmick is a FPS limiter, but also has tools mainly for Anarchy players. Xaero officially says not to use this because it causes crashes and bugs, and is affiliated with a griefing group, but I don't really care. |

No Lunar Client support. Understandable, they stole your mod. |
| [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) | None | Food/hunger-related HUD improvements | Client | Also installable on the server for saturation and exhaustion values (not necessary on singleplayer). Paper version is available, see the mod page.

| [Armor Visibility](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-visibility) | None | Let that skin show! | Client | Toggle with "V" by default, rebindable. Mod config lets you also show elytra, and hide it on mobs (bad idea) too. |

| [Not So Essential](https://modrinth.com/mod/notsoessential) |  Unknown | Keeps only what's Essential  | Client | Good for killing telmetry and a lot of features in Essential for those who use it as a dependancy, but you should really still avoid Essential entirely. |

| [3D\-Skin\-Layers](https://modrinth.com/mod/zV5r3pPn) | Unknown | Render the player skin layer in 3D! | Client | Works with CustomSkinLoader after installing [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinlayers3d-customskinloader-bridge). No Lunar Client support. Understandable, they stole your mod. |
| [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/EsAfCjCV) | None | Food/hunger-related HUD improvements | Client | Also installable on the server for saturation and exhaustion values (not necessary on singleplayer). Paper version is available, see the mod page. [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) has an alternative in the form of a Resource Pack, but is basic and does not show saturation or exhaustion, only the food's hunger values. |
| [Armor Visibility](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-visibility) | None | Let that skin show! | Client | Toggle with "V" by default, rebindable. Mod config lets you also show elytra, and hide it on mobs (bad idea) too. |

| [Chat Heads](https://modrinth.com/mod/Wb5oqrBJ) | Servers that use custom chat plugins [^1] | See who you're chatting with! | Client | Cracked servers work, but your skin may not update properly, especially if using SkinsRestorer. |

| [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) | None | A Minecraft mod that allows for efficient connected textures | Client | Their forge port ""exists"" but it functions with Sinytra Connector. AKA, **it's buggy, don't use it.** Reimplimentation of OptiFine's "Connected textures" feature. Works standalone (enable the built-in resource pack to connect glass) and with resource packs. |

Can be installed on either or, but if only the client has it and the server is unconfigured, the game might still force chat reports. A necessary addition since Gaslight. |

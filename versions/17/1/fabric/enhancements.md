| Name | Incompatibilities | Description | Client / Server | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [3D\-Skin\-Layers](https://modrinth.com/mod/3dskinlayers) | Unknown | Render the player skin layer in 3D! | Client | Works with CustomSkinLoader after installing [this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/skinlayers3d-customskinloader-bridge). No Lunar Client support. Understandable, they stole your mod. |
| [AppleSkin](https://modrinth.com/mod/appleskin) | None | Food/hunger-related HUD improvements | Client | Also installable on the server for saturation and exhaustion values (not necessary on singleplayer). Paper version is available, see the mod page. [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) has an alternative in the form of a Resource Pack, but is basic and does not show saturation or exhaustion, only the food's hunger values. |
| [Boosted Brightness](https://modrinth.com/mod/boosted-brightness) | Unknown | Set your brightness beyond default levels. | Client | May have incompatibility issues with some video option mods. |
| [Blur+](https://modrinth.com/mod/blur-plus) | Unknown | Spices up the boring vanilla blur effect â€“ featuring animations, colors and lots of customizability! | Client | Fork of Blur? I think? |
| [LambDynamicLights](https://modrinth.com/mod/lambdynamiclights) | Unknown | Adds dynamic lights to Minecraft as the most feature-complete and optimized dynamic lighting mod for Fabric. | Client | Implementation of OptiFine's "Dynamic Lights" feature. If you use shaders, use your shader pack's dedicated option instead. |

| [Client Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/client-tweaks) | Unknown |  Various optional tweaks to improve Minecraft Quality of Life. | Client | A bunch of random building related tweaks. Users with media key keyboards might experience issues with their volume slider hiding their offhand item. |
| [Night Vision Flash Be Gone!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/night-vision-flash-be-gone) | Unknown | I got fed up with the flash that happens when night vision is about to end, so I wrote a quick mod that removes that entirely. | Client | Might cause conflicts with other mods. |
| [Not So Essential](https://modrinth.com/mod/notsoessential) |  Unknown | Keeps only what's Essential  | Client | Good for killing telmetry and a lot of features in Essential for those who use it as a dependancy, but you should really still avoid Essential entirely. |
| [Zoomify](https://modrinth.com/mod/zoomify) | Unknown | A zoom mod with infinite customizability. | Client | Reimplementation of OptiFine's Zoom feature. You may also prefer [OK Zoomer](https://modrinth.com/mod/ok-zoomer) instead. |

| [Immersive Tips](modrinth.com/mod/immersive-tips) | Tips(?) | 1.20.1, 1.21.1 | Client | Has caused crashes in all configs I've installed it on. |
| [Reese's Sodium Options](https://modrinth.com/mod/reeses-sodium-options) | Non-sodium rendering engines | 1.16.5+ | Client | **For 90% of configs, it's safe to install this mod**, but it should be noticed that I've experienced crashes on a couple of configs, most noticeably 1.20.1 on Fabric. Be careful! |

| [Fastload](https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload) | Unknown | 1.18.x - 1.20.1 | Both | I've had poor experiences with this mod. Since 25w31a, you no longer need this mod because of changes to chunk loading, but if you need it, I'd rather you use Kyxsis, even if it's unstable. |
| [FPS to the Trash](https://modrinth.com/mod/fps-to-the-trash) | VulkanMod | 1.15+ | Client | Doesn't actually optimize the game, just tosses frames the monitor can't see. |
| [OptiFine](https://optifine.net) | Several mods | b1.7.3+ (except 1.21.5) | Client | [Many reasons.](./optifine.md) |

| [Extended Hotbar](https://modrinth.com/mod/extended-hotbar) | Unknown | 1.20.1, 1.20.4, 1.21.0-1.21.1 | Client | Causes UI issues on 1.20.1 and requires you to click on an offset. **Avoid.** |
| [Fractional GUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/fractionalgui) | Unknown | 1.18.2, 1.19.2-1.21.5 | Client | Non-whole number scales look bad. Also unsupported since 1.21.6. |

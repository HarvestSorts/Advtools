| [Immersive Tips](modrinth.com/mod/immersive-tips) | Tips(?) | 1.20.1, 1.21.1 | Client | Has caused crashes in all configs I've installed it on. |
| [Reese's Sodium Options](https://modrinth.com/mod/reeses-sodium-options) | Non-sodium rendering engines | 1.16.5+ | Client | **For 90% of configs, it's safe to install this mod**, but it should be noticed that I've experienced crashes on a couple of configs, most noticeably 1.20.1 on Fabric. Be careful! |

# Doesn't actually increase FPS

| [FPS to the Trash](https://modrinth.com/mod/fps-to-the-trash) | VulkanMod | 1.15+ | Client | Doesn't actually optimize the game, just tosses frames the monitor can't see. |
| [Noxesium](https://modrinth.com/mod/noxesium) | Unknown | 1.19.x - 1.21.x | Client | No actual sizable performance benefit. **Only useful for MCC Island and MC Championship users** / server runners who integrate Noxesium, since this mod is tailored to those users. Also included on Lunar Client. |

# Just not good

| [BetterFPS](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betterfps) | Unknown | 1.7.10 - 1.12.2 | Both | Doesn't actually do much for FPS. Also causes several issues. |
| [Fastload](https://modrinth.com/mod/fastload) | Unknown | 1.18.x - 1.20.1 | Both | I've had poor experiences with this mod. Since 25w31a, you no longer need this mod because of changes to chunk loading, but if you need it, I'd rather you use Kyxsis, even if it's unstable. |
| [OptiFine](https://optifine.net) | Several mods | b1.7.3+ (except 1.21.5) | Client | [Many reasons.](./optifine.md) |

| [Extended Hotbar](https://modrinth.com/mod/extended-hotbar) | Unknown | 1.20.1, 1.20.4, 1.21.0-1.21.1 | Client | Causes UI issues on 1.20.1 (on a specific configuration I've used on a friends only server) and requires you to click on an offset. **Avoid.** |
| [Fractional GUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/fractionalgui) | Unknown | 1.18.2, 1.19.2-1.21.5 | Client | Non-whole number scales look bad. Also unsupported since 1.21.6. |
| [ResourcePackCached](https://modrinth.com/mod/resourcepackcached) |  Unknown | 1.20.x - 1.21.x | Client | Keeps server packs loaded, even after reboots. **Also keeps server packs loaded from servers you haven't visited in a while**, which leads to server resource packs you forgot about making changes you don't like/remember. |

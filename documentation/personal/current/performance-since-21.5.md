# Game Performance since 1.21.5
<!-- TODO: write this in a way that's consistent with the other notes -->

Versions past 1.21.4 seem to currently have degraded performance. You can technically optimize them, but the performance may be lower than expected for the time being.

1.21.5+ has made breaking rendering changes, which has resulted in the Sodium project to wait for Mojang to cease their rendering chaos before they work on these versions. There is nothing you can do.

Also note that OptiFine does not support 1.21.5, therefore if you want to play on 1.21.5 with enhanced performance, your only real choice is to use **Sodium**, unless you don't mind Vanilla's poor performance.

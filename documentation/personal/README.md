# Adventure Tools: April Rivenend's Personal Notes
Some personal documentation on some stuff I might have also missed. Mainly includes notes I plan to look back on later, or just general notes that I want to gather together in a list to send to a friend.

Let's go through it all, now.

## Current Events
This is the main event and everything that you should know, whether you are a new or old player.

- [You shouldn't be using OptiFine](../optifine.md) (Some things to know)
- [Performance since 1.21.5 has been worse than expected](current/performance-since-21.5.md) (Your alternatives & why this is bad)
- [Chat Reports - PSA, FYI & What Is It?](current/reports.md)

## Mods
- [Curseforge vs. Modrinth](mods/curserinth.md) (why choose one or the other & some observations)

# Other notes that are too minor for a dedicated page
- If you are using 1.12, you should consider using [Cleanroom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cleanroom-relauncher) for performance benefits. (except if you have mod incompatibilities, of course)
- If you are using a version of Minecraft before 1.20.1 and/or you are on Forge, consider using Embeddium instead.
    - This does not apply to NeoForge users on 1.21
- Versions before 1.19 have optimizations, but they might be abandoned, less developed than their newer counterparts or might be outdated.
- You still need to use a Sodium fork on NeoForge 1.20.x.

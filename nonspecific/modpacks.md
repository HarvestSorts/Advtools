| [üèÜ Simply Optimized](modrinth.com/modpack/sop) | The leading, well-researched optimization modpack with a focus on pure performance. | HyperSoup | Community favorite, I think. They bundle their own fork of ModernFix with every version! |
| [‚≠ê Adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline) | Leading, lightweight, and unbiased performance modpack with no QoL features  | SkywardMC | Good alternative to Simply Optimized that I prefer over Simply Optimized |
| [Oganesson](https://modrinth.com/modpack/oganesson) | A modpack that will optimize Minecraft | bhop4real | Formerly known as NoWasting. Use version Oganesson 1.0.0-1.12.2 (Vintagium) for a pre-compiled Sodium 1.12 fork. |

# Modding Launchers
(a.k.a. "modded launchers", "modpack launchers", "what you probably want")

| [üèÜ Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) | An open source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free redistributability. | Prism Launcher team (& contributors) | This is my personal favorite launcher, it might be a bit much to look at for beginners, [Prism themselves have a guide](https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/) you could try looking at. Great for people who liked MultiMC but want more management *on top* of MultiMC's wonders. |
| [‚≠ê Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) | The Modrinth App is a unique, open source launcher that allows you to play your favorite mods, and keep them up to date, all in one neat little package. | Modrinth | I've not used it myself, but I've heard from many people that Modrinth's own launcher (called Modrinth App) is considered an amazing option for beginners. |
| [‚≠ê ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com) | ATLauncher is a simple and easy to use Minecraft Launcher which contains 154 modpacks for you to choose from, as well as the ability to browse and install packs from other platforms including CurseForge, Modrinth and Technic. | RyanTheAlmighty | ATLauncher is a solid mod management launcher with minimal issues in most cases. It swaps out the MultiMC based UI and some fancy stuff for Server management and creation. |
| [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/) | GDLauncher Carbon is a simple, yet powerful Minecraft custom launcher with a strong focus on the user experience  | Gorilla Devs | Legacy branch is deprecated. Carbon is their new launcher, but it has ads and you have to pay to remove them. You could try [this fork](https://github.com/Official-Husko/GDLauncher-Carbon-adless) which doesn't have them (at your own risk, of course). |
| [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) | MultiMC is an alternative launcher for Minecraft. It allows you to have multiple, cleanly separated instances of Minecraft (each with their own mods, resource packs, saves, etc) and helps you manage them and their associated options with a simple and powerful interface. | MultiMC team | Originally a GOAT of the Minecraft launcher space, but Prism outdoes MultIMC nowadays as Prism manages more instance stuff that MultiMC makes you do manually. |

# Clients and Client Launchers
(a.k.a. "strictpacks" (as described in [my old client rant](https://rentry.co/mclients)))  
You should still use alternative mods for [Lunar](https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/latest/lunar/) and [Feather](https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/latest/feather/)'s features where possible.

| [‚≠ê SkyClient](https://skyclient.co/) | An open installer to help you get all of the assets you need for Hypixel. | SkyClient team | 1.8.9 client based on Forge that's mainly intended for Hypixel users, however if all you play is 1.8 and you don't need anything else, Skyclient might be worth a look. |
| [‚ú®LabyMod](https://www.labymod.net/en) | Upgrade your Minecraft client experience to the next level. | LabyMod team | Labymod is a cool alternative to Lunar. It has a launcher for those who want something to be "launched" like Lunar but also has options for Prism users like myself, and can be installed as a mod in most cases. |
| [Axolotl Client](https://modrinth.com/mod/axolotlclient) | The most configurable HUD mod combined with everything else you might need to play - Your mod for the optimal PvP experience. | AxolotlClient team | AxolotlClient is a cool client mod for mod users. It might be too barebones for some, but it's a really cool alternative. |
| [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) | A modpack for all modern versions of Minecraft! | Lunar Team | Really ironic I put this here. It's an okay choice if you don't care about any capacity about modding or anything, but it's listed on Sodium's Supported Launcher list of "Launchers with known issues" list, so you should probably look for something else. |

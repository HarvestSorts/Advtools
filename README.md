# Advtools ("Adventure Tools")
A maximalist, "one for all" optimization guide for Minecraft with a wide range of versions covered. Separated by modloader, personal mod recommendations, and based on an actual configuration.  
Inspired by [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and [Radk6's "end-all, be-all" optimization guide](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Guide).

Where some guides mainly focus on being minimalist or only listing what actually matters, Advtools is a maximalist take and is based on the simple idea of "What if we just organized my way?"  
Advtools is note heavy and mainly focuses on documentation in mind.

Do remember that I am constantly updating Advtools, so some documentation might be untested, irrelevant, or otherwise

## Important notes
Here is where I'll put some short notes you should keep in mind.  
For more in-depth compatibility notes, see [my personal notes](documentation/personal) for more.

### Current events
- Since 1.19.1, you should install **No Chat Reports**, especially on 1.19.x versions where exploits are rampant
- Versions past 1.21.4 seem to currently have degraded performance and have no optimizations for them at this time

### Versions
- Pre-1.7 has poor and near zero mods to select from
- You still need to use OptiFine for 1.6 (& below) and 1.8 - 1.15 (until a replacement comes along for those versions)
- 1.7 and 1.8 *technically* have optimization mods, but their selection might be limited compared to newer versions
- Versions before 1.18 have optimizations, but they might be abandoned or less developed than their newer counterparts
- NeoForge is only supported on 1.20+ (excluding 1.20.0)

#### Mod related
- Neoforge on 1.20 does not natively support Sodium, you still need to use a fork (native support was added in 1.21)

<!-- TODO so these mods are compatible with these versions and need to be added

*** FORGE ***
https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight-forge - 1.17.1, 1.18.2, 1.19.x (except 1.19.4), 1.20-1.20.2

# Advtools ("Adventure Tools")
A maximalist, "one for all" optimization guide for Minecraft with a wide range of versions covered. Separated by modloader, personal mod recommendations, and based on an actual configuration.  
Inspired by [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and [Radk6's "end-all, be-all" optimization guide](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Guide).

Where some guides mainly focus on being minimalist or only listing what actually matters, Advtools is a maximalist take and is based on the simple idea of "What if we just organized my way?"  
Advtools is note heavy and mainly focuses on documentation in mind.

Do remember that I am constantly updating Advtools, so some documentation might be untested, irrelevant, or otherwise

## Notes
- Versions past 1.21.4 have degraded performance, according to Sodium's description for the 1.21.5+ releases.
- NeoForge is only supported on 1.20 and above (excluding 1.20.0).
- NeoForge on 1.20 does not natively support Sodium. 1.21+ does.

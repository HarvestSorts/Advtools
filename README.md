# Advtools
A maximalist optimization guide for various Minecraft versions, inspired by [TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and [Radk6's "end all, be all" guide](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Gu).

Adventure Tools is my own take on a resource guide, intended to cover more documentation, different organization, and organize mods by type and category where possible. It also includes an "enhancements" section, mostly based on my own personal selection of mods.  

Advtools is a very "mega" resource and tries to fill in the gaps on some obscure versions, including some versions that SMPs may still be running. That includes versions past 1.21.1, which some guides currently skip.

Advtools may not be for you. **Your mileage may vary.**  
Do remember that I am constantly updating Advtools, so some documentation might be untested, irrelevant, or otherwise

# Notes
Here is where I'll put some short notes you should keep in mind. For more detailed notes, you should still read everything else.

## Current events
- Since 1.19.1, you should install **No Chat Reports**, especially on 1.19.x versions where exploits are rampant
- Versions past 1.21.4 seem to currently have degraded performance. You can technically optimize them, but the performance may be lower than expected for the time being.

## Versions
- If you are using 1.12, you should consider using [Cleanroom](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cleanroom-relauncher) for performance benefits. (except if you have mod incompatibilities, of course)
- NeoForge is only supported on 1.20+ (excluding 1.20.0)


### Mod availability
- Pre-1.7 has poor and near zero mods to select from
- OptiFine is no longer necessary on 1.7 (Angelica), 1.12 (Vintagium, see Modpacks for a compiled version) and 1.16+. If you play 1.16.5 or 1.18.2-1.20.6, consider using Embeddium instead (especially on forge)
- Versions before 1.18 have optimizations, but they might be abandoned or less developed than their newer counterparts. Versions before 1.16 are especially at risk of being outdated.

### Other mod-related notes
- Neoforge on 1.20 does not natively support Sodium, you still need to use a fork (native support was added in 1.21)

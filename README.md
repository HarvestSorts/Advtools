# Advtools
A maximalist optimization guide for various Minecraft versions, [TheUsefulLists](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and [Radk6's "end all, be all" guide](https://github.com/Radk6/MC-Optimization-Gu).

Adventure Tools is my own take on a resource guide, intended to cover more documentation, different organization, and organize mods by type and category where possible. It also includes an "enhancements" section, mostly based on my own personal selection of mods.  

Advtools is a very "mega" resource and tries to fill in the gaps on some obscure versions, including some versions that SMPs may still be running. That includes versions past 1.21.1, which some guides currently skip.

Advtools may not be for you. **Your mileage may vary.**  
Do remember that I am constantly updating Advtools, so some documentation might be untested, irrelevant, or otherwise

# Notes
Here is where I'll put some short notes you should keep in mind.  
For more in-depth compatibility notes, see [my personal notes](documentation/personal) for more.

## Current events
- Since 1.19.1, you should install **No Chat Reports**, especially on 1.19.x versions where exploits are rampant
- Versions past 1.21.4 seem to currently have degraded performance. You can technically optimize them, but the performance may be lower than expected for the time being.

## Versions
- Pre-1.7 has poor and near zero mods to select from
- You still need to use OptiFine for 1.6 (& below) and 1.8 - 1.15 (until a replacement comes along for those versions)
- 1.7 and 1.8 *technically* have optimization mods, but their selection might be limited compared to newer versions
- Versions before 1.18 have optimizations, but they might be abandoned or less developed than their newer counterparts
- NeoForge is only supported on 1.20+ (excluding 1.20.0)

### Mod related
- Neoforge on 1.20 does not natively support Sodium, you still need to use a fork (native support was added in 1.21)
